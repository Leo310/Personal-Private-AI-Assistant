# Personal-Private-AI-Assistant
Your PPAA aka PAPA will help you at day to day task management and execution.

It is privacy focused, personalized and achieves nearly as good results as ChatGPT.

## Features
- **Easy Fine-Tuning/Customizing of your Model**
- Text-to-Speech Output
- Speech-to-Text Input
- Simple Prompt
- (Image processing)
- Accessible through an easy to integrate API

# The Why
- Generative AI got really good
- BUT AIs like ChatGPT only run in the cloud, because they are closed source and would be to big to run locally
- Do you really want to give all your personal information to these companies?

Probably not -> **Solution: PAPA tailored to your needs and running on your machine!**

# The How
- Alpaca model by Stanford which can be run locally
- Smallest 7B model already achieves better results then GPT-3
- Fine-Tuned with your personal informations
- Everything will be run locally

# The Who
I am a computer sience student building his next project and trying to leverage the huge potential and hype of LLMs.

**Every idea/help appreciated**
